The camt.053 end-of-day bank statement has almost 1,600 fields available highlighting the richness of information that can be supported through a more structured format. The camt.052 intraday statement also offers much richer
and potentially real-time reporting.

while banking partners are expected to continue providing the MT940 end-of-day balance and transaction report post November 2025, to its corporate client, there is now a risk where a corporate is using a proprietary bank statement consolidation service. This means today, the corporate could maintain 30+ banking relationships, but elect to receive the MT940 bank statement from their consolidator banking partner or technology provider only. Post the migration phase, all banks will only be able to send the MT940 equivalent end-of-day statement
— the camt.053 over the SWIFT interbank network. If the existing consolidator bank cannot offer a backward conversion from XML (camt.053) to FIN (MT940), this will require the corporate to also migrate onto the camt.053 end-of-day bank statement or consider other possible alternatives.
